                <p className='About-para'>I'm a JavaScript developer with a strong interest in building responsive, interactive, and scalable web applications. I primarily work with React for frontend development, using Tailwind CSS for fast and clean UI design. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building user interfaces that are both accessible and performant.

Recently, I’ve been expanding into full-stack development, leveraging Node.js and Express.js on the backend to build RESTful APIs, handle server-side logic, and integrate with databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL. My projects often involve API integration, state management, authentication, and component-based architecture, enabling me to deliver fully functional, end-to-end web applications.

I enjoy using tools like Git, VS Code, Postman, and browser developer tools to streamline my workflow and deliver efficient, production-ready applications. In addition to my technical skills, I’m passionate about crafting smooth user experiences and ensuring cross-browser and cross-device compatibility. I keep up with modern JavaScript features, React best practices, and emerging full-stack trends to continuously improve my work.

I also have experience in designing and consuming RESTful APIs, handling JSON data, and optimizing application performance through code-splitting, lazy loading, caching, and server-side optimizations. My backend work often focuses on building scalable architectures, implementing secure authentication systems (JWT, OAuth), and ensuring efficient data flow between client and server.

I thrive in collaborative environments, but I’m equally comfortable taking ownership of a project from concept to deployment. My goal is to create applications that not only meet functional requirements but also provide an intuitive and enjoyable user experience for end-users while maintaining robust, scalable, and secure backend infrastructure.</p>
